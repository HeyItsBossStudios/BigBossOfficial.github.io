                <p>So you want to learn a little about me eh? Well then I guess I should tell you then
                    I'm from canada so I live in an igloo, I'm kidding but anyway I like music and I like making
                    music, I'm not a good singer or rapper so I like to make Spoken word music because I can get 
                    my message across the same way as rap or singing but I don't need to worry about following beats as much.
                    My music isn't the best I know but I try to make the best music that I can, I hope y'all like it 
                    and I will be releasing some more music soon. Be on the lookout,  It will be both here and on my SoundCloud,
                    I will have some exclusive tracks on here so If you want to hear them then make sure to come back to take a look.
